- 👋 Hi, I’m @GypsyWitchRhiannon
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things.  I was never good with technology.  I had to self teach, it's bad.  I can't even play video games.  I am trying to face 
and conquer things felt I couldn't do.  Plus, it's pretty badass in my opinion.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... As mush as I can. Hopefully I am doing things correctly and thoroughly.  I am mostly on my own so any help is welcomed.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Whoa now haven't gotten that far yet... Kidding.   I have no clue.
- 📫 How to reach me at my email...  When I decide to put it up in the near future.
